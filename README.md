# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a coding puzzle each day from December 1st to December 25th.

## Goals

My goals for participating in Advent of Code this year are:

- Improve my problem-solving skills.
- Practice Python.
- Complete all the puzzles within the month of December.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each day's puzzle is in its own directory, e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.
- Inside each directory, there is a script for the solution and a text file with the puzzle input.
- A README file in each directory explains the day's challenge.

## Progress

| Day | Puzzle | Status |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | [Link to Puzzle](day01/trebuchet.py) | :star: :star: |
| 2   | [Link to Puzzle](day02/cube-conundrum.py) | :star: :star: |

_(:star: indicates each part of the puzzle solved)_

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, navigate to the day's directory and run the script. For example:

```bash
cd day01
python3 solution.py
```
